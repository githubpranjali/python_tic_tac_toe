This is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python, designed for two players. The game features a simple, interactive console interface where players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. It checks for win conditions after every move and declares a winner or a draw when the game ends. Key features include input validation, a clear display of the game board after each turn, and logic to handle invalid moves (like choosing an already occupied cell). This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including loops, conditionals, and functions.
